hello this is a story about Jin.

Jin was such a shy boy.

He was always worried about how other people look at him.

But he used this worried energy to better himself.

First he tried to figure out what he is worried about, why he thinks that he should be worried about objectively.

Some were just created only in his brain. Some turned out that the problems lied within himself.

He tried to make friends and people started to like him.

He is a self taught programmer.
